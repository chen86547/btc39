The exchange between virtual currencies and traditional currencies can be carried out in the following ways:


Exchanges: Users can buy or sell virtual currencies on online exchanges and exchange them for traditional currencies (such as US dollars, euros, etc.).


Banks: Some banks have begun to support virtual currency transactions, and users can exchange virtual currencies with traditional currencies at banks.


P2P exchange: Users can exchange virtual currencies and traditional currencies directly with other users without going through an exchange.


ATM: Some virtual currency ATMs have begun to provide exchange services between virtual currencies and traditional currencies, and users can exchange them at the ATM.
Cryptocurrency projects can take the following steps to keep their networks safe:


Encryption technology: Virtual currency projects can use encryption technology (such as SHA-256, Ethereum, etc.) to protect network security.


Node verification: Virtual currency projects can ensure network security through node verification to ensure that only legitimate nodes participate in network transactions.


Smart Contracts: Cryptocurrency projects can use smart contracts to automatically execute and verify transactions, thereby maintaining network security.


Supervision and auditing: Cryptocurrency projects can ensure network security and comply with relevant regulations and standards through supervision and auditing.
